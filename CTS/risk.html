                <h1>Risks</h1>
                <p>Current Concerns for AI and its risks are primarily centred around its ability to replace and create unemployment issues for millions of primarily white collared workers who rely on having these jobs to have a living and a steady stream of income. This is also prevalent in the IT sector with many roles facing lower demand due to AI as now one worker with the help of AI can do the job of multiple workers leaving those workers unemployed. Another way AI poses a risk in the IT sector is complete redundancy for lower-level IT jobs and in some cases higher-level IT jobs.
                <br> <br>
                This is shown to potentially impact jobs such as
                <ul>
                    <li>Software Developers and Programmers</li>
                    <li>Cyber Security Analysts</li>
                    <li>Administrators</li>
                    <li>IT support and Helpdesk</li>
                    <li>Data Entry and Data Analysis</li>
                    </ul>
                <br> <br>
                In the case of Software Developers and Programmers,
AI products aimed at boosting productivity could potentially be a threat to job security in these fields as it is possible that if AI’s performance in these fields becomes too powerful it may leave some workers redundant, and others not in demand as the few developers/programmers have been empowered by AI coding tools can be more productive than having multiple people working together.
<br> <br>
In the case of Cyber Security Analysts
Currently, AI is being used to detect and respond to threats more quickly and potentially diagnose issues faster than humans can. 	But in the case of Cyber Security analysts, this could be not as detrimental in the future due to the large shortage in the industry but will play a role in filling up such a shortage potentially creating issues down the line for future Cyber Security analysts.
<br> <br>
In the case of Network Administrators
Similar to the case of Cyber Security Analysts in some cases it may enhance some worker’s tasks to where it may leave less room for others, and in other cases, it may outright replace the workers in the position. According to ISC2’s  2023 ISC2 Artificial Intelligence Survey, 71% of participants see it being used to monitor network traffic for signs of malware.
<br> <br>
In the case of IT support and Helpdesk
Currently, AI chatbots are being used to help support customers who have technical issues, while currently they are not as good as human support workers, but in the future AI may be able to keep up with human workers or potentially outpace them in the IT support and helpdesk industries and could
