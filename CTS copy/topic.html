          <p>AI or Artificial intelligence handles high volume repetition, and computerised activities rather than automating manual product, and it does all this without fatigue or exhaustion affecting it. Naturally, human operation is still required to configure and adjust the systems. Most products you use in your day to day life will have been improved significantly with AI capabilities, similar to how Siri was included in a new bach of apple products. A wide range of technology may be enhanced by combining mass volumes of data with, automation, conversational platforms, bots, and sophisticated robots. Improvements in the home and office include investment analysis, smart cameras, and security intelligence. Incremental learning methods help allow AI to adapt by letting the data organise and handle the programming, in which helping it learn the algorithms by looking for patterns and structure in mass loads of data. Algorithms can educate and teach itself to propose a product online or train itself to play chess at high levels. Furthermore, the models adjust to fresh data. AI uses networks with several hidden layers to analyse deeper data. It used to be hard to build a system to identify fraud with five hidden levels. Big data and amazing computing power have transformed all of that. Since AI learns from deep learning models,  a large amount of data is required for training. Using the Deep Neural networks, it allows AI to reach remarkable precision in tasks it undergoes. Deep learning, is the foundation for all of your google, siri and alexa searches. With AI learning as you search, the more you use these items the more accurate AI becomes. AI methods from object identification and deep learning are currently applied in the medical area to more accurately identify cancer on medical pictures. AI maximises the value of data. The data itself is useful when algorithms are self-learning. You only need to use AI to locate the answers, which are already present in the data. Having mass amounts of data stored may provide a competitive edge since its function is more crucial than ever.</div>

          <h2>Where is AI Technology Being Applied?</h2>
          <br>
          <p>AI solutions are being used in almost every area of the world, with outstanding reactions and results. A few particualkr areas that Artifical intelligences have shown sucesffulness are healthcare, retail, manufcaturing and banking. In healthcare AI apps are used to provide tailored treatment to individuals, which remind patients to take their medications and suggest aciticites they can par take in to help their situation. In retail AI is used to manage inventory, create more efficient store designs, and offer tailored recommendations for products for the user. The recommendations that AI generates usually appears in the "You May Also Like" suggestions and tailored recommendations for movies to watch through Netflix's machine learning-powered recommendation system. In the manufacturing sector, AI solutions are used to predict load and demand for factories. This ensures that they operate as efficetvely as possible by improving the logistics and planning choices on ordering supplies which therefore improces their project completion timelines. In the banking sector AI used to analyze financial transactions in order to spot fraudulent behaviour, determine credit ratings for customers and automate processes that call for human data entry and administration.

          <h2>Advantages and Disadvantages</h2>
          <p>Their are multiple advantages and disadvantages to AI, that give most business a cutting edge towards business that dont use Artifical Intelgianece.</p> 
            
            <p>Pros: </p>
            <p>The first major advantage in Artifical Intelligence is the elimination of human error and risk, Every human makes mistakes which is a natural thing, When it comes to AI completing tasks they show consistent results in a faster time that humans. Similarly it prevents the risk to humans when dangerous tasks are involved, Robots employed in high-radiation locations are one example of AI assuming risks instead of people. Radiation can cause significant illness or even death in humans, yet it has no effect on robots. Additionally, the robot may be rebuilt in the event of a tragic error. Another positive is the cost reduction, with AI being able to work 24/7 and doing more work then a average human who can be affected by fatigue. Giving AI the opportunity to work on the more repetitive tasks gives the opportunity to free up workers for the tasks that require higher skills.</p>
            
            <p>Cons: </p>
            <p>AI provides many benefits, as seen by the long list of benefits mentioned above; yet, there are drawbacks as well, such as installation costs and gradual deterioration. The costly implementation of AI into business can be a drawback for most companies. One estimate says that the average cost for a fully implemented AI solution into a business can range from $20,000 to the high millions. The lack of creativity and emotion can also effect the creative ideas in certain business. Humans naturally take the emotional implications into account while making delicate judgments. AI lacks the capacity and can only choose the best option given the constraints given, regardless of the emotional implications. Another major drawback is the reduced jobs for human employees, Which may result in fewer employment becoming available as it gets more widely used in businesses. This is because AI is capable of doing monotonous activities that humans once performed. </p>

            <h2>Ethical Concerns</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Their are a numerous amount of ethical concerns regarding the use of Artifical Intelligence. The main concern that users have is the protection of customer data, the long-term availability of data presents several challenges for the informed consent of the individuals whose data it is. Not to add, AI can collect data on people even in the absence of direct access to personal information since it is adept at identifying trends. Other ethical issues include the issue of unemployment, legal accountability, and other issues.
