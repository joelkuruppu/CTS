          <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is a revolutionary development of technology and is being incorporated into every facade of technology. With these advancements comes the responsibility of how to manage and utilise this technology. A variety of industries actively seek to operate more AI within their workplace. 
            The IT industry is a particular interest for BCIS students and understanding the choices being made in relation to AIs role in employment is essential. Several AI systems and methodologies are currently in use and tailored into a variety of roles and jobs. The choices made by potential users regarding the usage 
            and implementation of AI into jobs are complex due to several factors involved for effective integration of AI in a workplace.Examining the implications of AI inclusion and regarding the necessity for job markets to adapt to accommodate AI-supported employee performance is vital.
            Recognising these impacts is important for prospective workers and society in general.

          <p>Various AI systems and methodologies are presently employed by a diverse number of industries. AI systems are engineered to aid in various roles and occupations. and jobs. Selenko et al. (2022) explain concurrent observation or interference in workplaces is existing work that is assisted and supplemented by new programs that AI is able to supply. 
            Common methodologies seen are machine learning and deep learning. Miah (2024) describes that providing industries with official information workflows can influence its abilities productively, minimisation of continuation expenses, and ease in acquiring details from digital information are advantages of machine learning, a branch of AI.
            These advantages are what potential users appraise when deliberating the use and role of AI. Complicated selection processes, monotonous jobs such as planning, analysis and information retrieval, and recurring and strenuous duties formally completed by employees, are numerous laboring and cognitive functions that have the potential to be replaced by 
            AI-supported operations (Selenko et at., 2022). Hence these possibilities of enhanced productivity and efficiency influence the modification of AI inclusion into jobs and are described to function alongside employees.</p>

            <p>The decisions prospective users determine for usage and implementation of AI into jobs can be complex and multilayered, furthermore several factors for effective integration of AI in a workplace must be considered. Investment in apprehension of AI learning, guaranteed data condition, data handling problems necessitating 
                cooperation with AI providers and the shortage of AI specialists are obstacles to be mitigated (Miah, 2024). As a result of this, companies and employers would need to plan accordingly for AI inclusion as well as factor in employee skill sets and the foundations needed for AI usage. Implementing this technology 
                changes the priority of skills and expertise and so will affect the job market. This brings forward the fact that a workplace and its system would require preparation for AI assimilation first. AI brings many innovations and in contrast, many fears of job displacement, loss, and unsure futures. 
                Bankins et al. (2024) state that through deliberate and practical cooperation between personal and technology will the productiveness and effectiveness of AI be understood.Companies in the IT industry would have this understanding as well as understand the importance of cooperation; however, for a wider perspective, 
                thoughtful consideration for generating a worker-AI partnership to lessen fears of AI replacement and instead approach AI as an assistant. Advancement in employment, utilisation of skills, payment increase and developed work procedures are produced when AI is enacted to generate new worker jobs or help workers (Bankins et at., 2024). 
                Thus, how AI is approached and designed will influence the effectiveness of AI in occupations. Furthermore, the implication of AI in a workplace will significantly reshape the job market to accommodate AI.

                <p>Discussing the implications of incorporating AI and the necessity for job markets to adapt to AI-enhanced employee performance is crucial. Understanding these effects is important for future workers and society. Considering the rising demand for more AI involvement in various industries, adjustments in employability capability are expected. 
                    Poba-Nzaou et al (2021) claim that higher-order Intellectual and socioemotional adeptness, modern and computer technologies expertise are anticipated to be favored towards. Realising this trend will enable students and the future workforce to anticipate and prepare for this effect in the job market. Poba-Nzaou et al (2021) conclude that corporations, 
                    governments and educational institutions need to be driven in the pursuit for global answers as the uncontrollable behavior of AI in occupations is unprecedented and Tschang and Almirall (2021) comment that a necessity will arise for policy to secure careers for sustainable sources of income if AI-induced mechanisation substitutes increasingly more work, 
                    and majority of the remaining work is condensed into small-scale, greatly technical personnel. Both statements could also be said that these institutions and corporations have a responsibility to guide AI adaptation in a direction that promotes AI literacy and education to society and into a path that prioritises ethical and equitable AI implementation.
