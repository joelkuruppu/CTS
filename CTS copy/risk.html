          <p>Current Concerns for AI and its risks are primarily centred around its ability to replace and create unemployment issues for millions of primarily white collared workers who rely on having these jobs to have a living and a steady stream of income. This is also prevalent in the IT sector with many roles facing lower demand due to AI as now one worker with the help of AI can do the job of multiple workers leaving those workers unemployed. Another way AI poses a risk in the IT sector is complete redundancy for lower-level IT jobs and in some cases higher-level IT jobs. This is shown to potentially impact jobs such as

          <h2>In the case of Software Developers and Programmers.</h2>
          <p>AI products aimed at boosting productivity could potentially be a threat to job security in these fields as it is possible that if AI’s performance in these fields becomes too powerful it may leave some workers redundant, and others not in demand as the few developers/programmers have been empowered by AI coding tools can be more productive than having multiple people working together.

            <h2>In the case of Cyber Security Analysts</h2>
          <p>Currently, AI is being used to detect and respond to threats more quickly and potentially diagnose issues faster than humans can. But in the case of Cyber Security analysts, this could be not as detrimental in the future due to the large shortage in the industry but will play a role in filling up such a shortage potentially creating issues down the line for future Cyber Security analysts. </p>

            <h2>In the case of Network Administrators</h2>
            <p>Similar to the case of Cyber Security Analysts in some cases it may enhance some worker’s tasks to where it may leave less room for others, and in other cases, it may outright replace the workers in the position. According to ISC2’s 2023 ISC2 Artificial Intelligence Survey, 71% of participants see it being used to monitor network traffic for signs of malware.

                <h2>In the case of Data Entry and Data Analysis</h2>
                <p>AI is being developed at a rapid rate to where Data Entry and analysis could be deprecated already with the ability for AI to perform basic analysis faster and produce this analysis with fewer errors than most humans. This is already affecting the work balance between humans and AI in this industry.

                    <h2>In the case of IT support and Helpdesk</h2>
                    <p>Currently, AI chatbots are being used to help support customers who have technical issues, while currently they are not as good as human support workers, but in the future AI may be able to keep up with human workers or potentially outpace them in the IT support and helpdesk industries and could be used to resolve simple support tasks such as resolving password issues and diagnosing network issues for other employees in a company.

                    <p>Not only are there ramifications to these effects due to the loss of employment. But also the increased cost of current employees potential students and others who have invested their time and money into the industries that AI is prone to replace in the near future. The training and redirection for the employees who are forced to make a shift towards industries and jobs that are not affected by AI or greatly benefit from AI. 

                        This has ramifications for the employees and or companies who are willing to develop and redirect their employees into new positions for their business. This Cost includes time lost to learning new skills, the cost of learning these new skills e.g. certifications/courses, and the cost of not having these employees working and potentially generating revenue for the business. This is the best case scenario for workers whose jobs have been replaced, where the employer is willing to invest in them to continue their employee employer relationship. But In reality, there are many employers who will be unwilling to fund and develop their existing talent into new jobs that have not been made redundant by AI. Many workers will have to fund these reskilling and career pivots themselves which could lead to many workers falling out of the workforce as they are unable to afford to upskill themselves or pivot their career in a meaningful way.
